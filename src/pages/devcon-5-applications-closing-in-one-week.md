Watch out for the [Devcon 5](https://devcon.org/) applications. You only have one week left to apply either as

* [Buidler](https://devcon.org/apply/builder-discount)
* [Student](https://devcon.org/apply/student-discount)
* [Scholarship](https://devcon.org/apply/scholarship)
* [Press](https://devcon.org/apply/press-pass)

Devcon is by far the biggest and most impressive Ethereum conference in the world. And it's full of developers! I am especially excited about the cool location this year in Osaka. Full price tickets are not cheap, but worth every cent.

## **When do the main tickets go on sale?**

Expect it to happen soon after the application deadline. Even if you have submitted an application, you're not guaranteed to get accepted. So watch out for the main ticket sales just in case. And beware that tickets sell out extremely quickly. The last round for Devcon 4 took 3 minutes to sell out!



Do you have any tips for Osaka? Please share them.
